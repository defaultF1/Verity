# Verity - "The Truth Behind the Clause"
## Hackathon Pitch Script (2 Minutes)

**(0:00 - 0:30) THE HOOK**

"How many of you have clicked 'I Accept' without reading the terms?
*(Pause for effect)*
We all have.
As of 2026, India is home to **30 Million freelancers**—the largest gig workforce in the world.
And yet, 80% of their contracts contain clauses that are actually **illegal** under Indian Law—specifically **Section 27** of the Indian Contract Act."

**(0:30 - 1:00) THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION**

"Corporations use intimidation. They bury you in legalese so you don't realize you're signing away your right to work for a competitor.
Existing AI tools just summarize the text. They tell you *what* it says.
**Verity tells you if it's legal.**
We built an AI agent specifically trained on Indian Case Law—like *Percept D'Mark v. Zaheer Khan*—to act not just as a reader, but as a judge."

**(1:00 - 1:45) THE DEMO**

"Let me show you.
*(Open Landing Page)*
I'm a freelancer. I've just received this 'Standard Consultant Agreement'. It looks professional.
I click **'Upload Contract'**.
*(Click Upload -> Sign In -> Analysis)*
Verity scans the PDF. It doesn't just look for keywords; it looks for *intent*.
And... there it is.
*(Point to the 'VOID' Stamp)*
**'VOID'**.
Verity flagged a non-compete clause that tries to ban me from working for 6 months after leaving. In India, that is unenforceable.
It cites the exact Supreme Court ruling that protects me."


**(1:45 - 2:15) THE TECHNOLOGY (3-LAYER ARCHITECTURE)**

"If you're wondering how we achieve this accuracy, Verity uses a **3-Layer Architecture**:
1.  **Interaction Layer**: Built on Next.js 16 for a seamless, secure upload experience.
2.  **Orchestration Layer**: Our middleware sanitizes and parses the raw legal text.
3.  **Intelligence Layer**: We use Claude 3.5 Sonnet not as a chatbot, but as a **Reasoning Engine**, applying specific Indian Contract Law constraints to every clause."

**(2:15 - 2:30) THE CLOSING**

"We don't just highlight the problem; we fix it. With one click, I can generate a counter-offer that strikes out the illegal clause.
Legalese is designed to obscure. Verity is designed to reveal.
Thank you."
